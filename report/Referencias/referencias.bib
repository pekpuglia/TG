abstract = {A complete analytic study about the influence of Earth's oblateness on the optimal low-thrust limited power transfer of small amplitude (orbit correction) between quasi-circular orbits of small inclinations is carried out up to the first order in a small parameter defined by the nondimensional thrust acceleration. The coefficient for the second zonal harmonic J20 and the nondimensional thrust acceleration are supposed to be the same order of magnitude. Hori's method for generalized canonical systems is applied in order to obtain the analytical solution for adjoint and state differential equations. Simple analytic solutions are obtained explicitly for long-time transfer.}

    abstract = { The question of how many impulses are necessary to optimize a transfer-type maneuver has remained open for decades. Recently, the introduction of optimal switching surfaces revealed the existence of iso-impulse trajectories with differing numbers of impulses for fixed-time rendezvous maneuvers. In this paper, the multiplicity of minimum-Δv impulsive trajectories is studied for long-time-horizon maneuvers. One feature of these trajectories is that many of the impulses are applied at specific positions, which we coin as impulse anchor positions. Leveraging a novel analytic method, it is demonstrated that, under the inverse-square gravity model, multiple-impulse minimum-Δv solutions can be generated from a two-impulse solution. In addition to recovering all impulsive solutions of a multirevolution benchmark problem, all solutions are classified, and it is shown that there are infinitely many optimal iso-impulse solutions. Two planet-centric problems are also solved to demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to different transfer problems in addition to the benchmark problem. The proposed method provides analytic bounds on the lower (required) and upper (allowable) number of impulses for three classes of maneuvers: fixed-terminal-time rendezvous, free-terminal-time rendezvous, and phase-free transfer. A new interpretation of the primer vector for impulsive extremals with phasing orbits is proposed. }

    abstract = { Impulsive trajectories provide time- and ΔV-reachability insights. Two novel homotopy-based methods are proposed for generating optimal many-impulse, multirevolution maneuvers. The first method is based on the continuation over the specific impulse value, which is shown to enhance convergence performance of the resulting two-point boundary-value problems. The second method is based on the formulation of impulsive trajectories using a linear acceleration term. The two methods are used in a hybrid framework. The utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated on four problems: Two interplanetary trajectories 1) from Earth to Mars, 2) from Earth to asteroid Dionysus, 3) a planet-centric transfer maneuver from a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary orbit (GEO) consisting of 21 revolutions, and 4) a 50-revolution transfer from the considered GTO to a circular orbit at the first Lagrange point (L1) of the Earth–moon system. The last two problems leading to 18 and 50 impulses are tackled to give an optimal near-impulsive solution. The impulsive solution with 18 impulses is shown to satisfy Lawden’s conditions. }

abstract = {In this paper, a new optimization approach combining primer vector theory and evolutionary algorithms for fuel-optimal non-linear impulsive rendezvous is proposed. The optimization approach is designed to seek the optimal number of impulses as well as the optimal impulse vectors. In this optimization approach, adding a midcourse impulse is determined by an interactive method, i.e. observing the primer-magnitude time history. An improved version of simulated annealing is employed to optimize the rendezvous trajectory with the fixed-number of impulses. This interactive approach is evaluated by three test cases: coplanar circle-to-circle rendezvous, same-circle rendezvous and non-coplanar rendezvous. The results show that the interactive approach is effective and efficient in fuel-optimal non-linear rendezvous design. It can guarantee solutions, which satisfy the Lawden's necessary optimality conditions.}

abstract = {The simplified general perturbations 4 (SGP4) orbital propagation model is one of the most widely used methods for rapidly and reliably predicting the positions and velocities of objects orbiting Earth. Over time, SGP models have undergone refinement to enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Nevertheless, they still do not match the precision offered by high-precision numerical propagators, which can predict the positions and velocities of space objects in low-Earth orbit with significantly smaller errors. In this study, we introduce a novel differentiable version of SGP4, named ∂SGP4. By porting the source code of SGP4 into a differentiable program based on PyTorch, we unlock a whole new class of techniques enabled by differentiable orbit propagation, including spacecraft orbit determination, state conversion, covariance similarity transformation, state transition matrix computation, and covariance propagation. Besides differentiability, our ∂SGP4 supports parallel propagation of a batch of two-line elements (TLEs) in a single execution and it can harness modern hardware accelerators like GPUs or XLA devices (e.g. TPUs) thanks to running on the PyTorch backend. Furthermore, the design of ∂SGP4 makes it possible to use it as a differentiable component in larger machine learning (ML) pipelines, where the propagator can be an element of a larger neural network that is trained or fine-tuned with data. Consequently, we propose a novel orbital propagation paradigm, ML-∂SGP4. In this paradigm, the orbital propagator is enhanced with neural networks attached to its input and output. Through gradient-based optimization, the parameters of this combined model can be iteratively refined to achieve precision surpassing that of SGP4. Fundamentally, the neural networks function as identity operators when the propagator adheres to its default behavior as defined by SGP4. However, owing to the differentiability ingrained within ∂SGP4, the model can be fine-tuned with ephemeris data to learn corrections to both inputs and outputs of SGP4. This augmentation enhances precision while maintaining the same computational speed of ∂SGP4 at inference time. This paradigm empowers satellite operators and researchers, equipping them with the ability to train the model using their specific ephemeris or high-precision numerical propagation data.}

The scope of earlier studies is extended by including various methods that have been developed only recently. Several performance tests reveal that modern single- and multistep methods can be similarly efficient over a wide range of eccentricities. Multistep methods are still preferable, however, for ephemeris predictions with a large number of dense output points.},
