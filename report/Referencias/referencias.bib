abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the mathematics needed to model, analyze, and design feedback systems. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, and is indispensable for researchers seeking a self-contained reference on control theory. Unlike most books on the subject, Feedback Systems develops transfer functions through the exponential response of a system, and is accessible across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl strm and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. strm and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness. They provide exercises at the end of every chapter, and an accompanying electronic solutions manual is available. Feedback Systems is a complete one-volume resource for students and researchers in mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.Covers the mathematics needed to model, analyze, and design feedback systems Serves as an introductory textbook for students and a self-contained resource for researchers Includes exercises at the end of every chapter Features an electronic solutions manual Offers techniques applicable across a range of disciplines}

    abstract = { The question of how many impulses are necessary to optimize a transfer-type maneuver has remained open for decades. Recently, the introduction of optimal switching surfaces revealed the existence of iso-impulse trajectories with differing numbers of impulses for fixed-time rendezvous maneuvers. In this paper, the multiplicity of minimum-Δv impulsive trajectories is studied for long-time-horizon maneuvers. One feature of these trajectories is that many of the impulses are applied at specific positions, which we coin as impulse anchor positions. Leveraging a novel analytic method, it is demonstrated that, under the inverse-square gravity model, multiple-impulse minimum-Δv solutions can be generated from a two-impulse solution. In addition to recovering all impulsive solutions of a multirevolution benchmark problem, all solutions are classified, and it is shown that there are infinitely many optimal iso-impulse solutions. Two planet-centric problems are also solved to demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to different transfer problems in addition to the benchmark problem. The proposed method provides analytic bounds on the lower (required) and upper (allowable) number of impulses for three classes of maneuvers: fixed-terminal-time rendezvous, free-terminal-time rendezvous, and phase-free transfer. A new interpretation of the primer vector for impulsive extremals with phasing orbits is proposed. }

    abstract = { Impulsive trajectories provide time- and ΔV-reachability insights. Two novel homotopy-based methods are proposed for generating optimal many-impulse, multirevolution maneuvers. The first method is based on the continuation over the specific impulse value, which is shown to enhance convergence performance of the resulting two-point boundary-value problems. The second method is based on the formulation of impulsive trajectories using a linear acceleration term. The two methods are used in a hybrid framework. The utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated on four problems: Two interplanetary trajectories 1) from Earth to Mars, 2) from Earth to asteroid Dionysus, 3) a planet-centric transfer maneuver from a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary orbit (GEO) consisting of 21 revolutions, and 4) a 50-revolution transfer from the considered GTO to a circular orbit at the first Lagrange point (L1) of the Earth–moon system. The last two problems leading to 18 and 50 impulses are tackled to give an optimal near-impulsive solution. The impulsive solution with 18 impulses is shown to satisfy Lawden’s conditions. }

abstract = {In this paper, a new optimization approach combining primer vector theory and evolutionary algorithms for fuel-optimal non-linear impulsive rendezvous is proposed. The optimization approach is designed to seek the optimal number of impulses as well as the optimal impulse vectors. In this optimization approach, adding a midcourse impulse is determined by an interactive method, i.e. observing the primer-magnitude time history. An improved version of simulated annealing is employed to optimize the rendezvous trajectory with the fixed-number of impulses. This interactive approach is evaluated by three test cases: coplanar circle-to-circle rendezvous, same-circle rendezvous and non-coplanar rendezvous. The results show that the interactive approach is effective and efficient in fuel-optimal non-linear rendezvous design. It can guarantee solutions, which satisfy the Lawden's necessary optimality conditions.}
