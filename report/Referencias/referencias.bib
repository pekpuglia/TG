abstract = {A complete analytic study about the influence of Earth's oblateness on the optimal low-thrust limited power transfer of small amplitude (orbit correction) between quasi-circular orbits of small inclinations is carried out up to the first order in a small parameter defined by the nondimensional thrust acceleration. The coefficient for the second zonal harmonic J20 and the nondimensional thrust acceleration are supposed to be the same order of magnitude. Hori's method for generalized canonical systems is applied in order to obtain the analytical solution for adjoint and state differential equations. Simple analytic solutions are obtained explicitly for long-time transfer.}
