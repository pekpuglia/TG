abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the mathematics needed to model, analyze, and design feedback systems. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, and is indispensable for researchers seeking a self-contained reference on control theory. Unlike most books on the subject, Feedback Systems develops transfer functions through the exponential response of a system, and is accessible across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl strm and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. strm and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness. They provide exercises at the end of every chapter, and an accompanying electronic solutions manual is available. Feedback Systems is a complete one-volume resource for students and researchers in mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.Covers the mathematics needed to model, analyze, and design feedback systems Serves as an introductory textbook for students and a self-contained resource for researchers Includes exercises at the end of every chapter Features an electronic solutions manual Offers techniques applicable across a range of disciplines}

abstract = {A complete analytic study about the influence of Earth's oblateness on the optimal low-thrust limited power transfer of small amplitude (orbit correction) between quasi-circular orbits of small inclinations is carried out up to the first order in a small parameter defined by the nondimensional thrust acceleration. The coefficient for the second zonal harmonic J20 and the nondimensional thrust acceleration are supposed to be the same order of magnitude. Hori's method for generalized canonical systems is applied in order to obtain the analytical solution for adjoint and state differential equations. Simple analytic solutions are obtained explicitly for long-time transfer.}
