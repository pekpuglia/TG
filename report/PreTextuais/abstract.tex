This work presents the implementation of an orbital maneuver solver under two-body Keplerian dynamics and impulsive thrust model. The control task consists of finding the trajectory between two given states, in a fixed amount of time, minimizing fuel consumption. Optimal control formalism, in the form of the control Hamiltonian, is applied to the problem to uncover the consacrated primer vector theory, which can inform hyperparameter choice. A Julia interface to the recognized Ipopt solver is used to implement a relaxation method for the optimizer. A Lambert problem solver is used to supply a feasible initial guess to the solver. Finally, the results of direct optimization and primer vector theory are compared to the established Hohmann transfer analytical results to validate the implementation.
