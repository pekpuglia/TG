I would like to thank professors Willer Santos and Ma√≠sa Terra for teaching me orbital mechanics and proposing this subject, which has been on my mind since my early days of playing Kerbal Space Program. 

I would also like to thank professor Emilien Flayac, who introduced me to optimal control, and showed me that really abstract mathematics is, in fact, useful. I also thank professors Iain Henderson and Benjamin Bobbia, who helped me with many informal discussions about details of complicated bits of math in my work.

I thank Bruno Sarli, who helped me with early questions I had back when nothing worked and the results seemed awful, Ronan Chagas, who is responsible for the SatelliteToolbox package, which helped me greatly throughout this work, and puts INPE on the international scene of Julia programming, and Caio Accioly, with whom I discussed some of the hairy parts of orbital mechanics.
